**Disclaimer:** This is a simulated Electronic Health Record (EHR) and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis or treatment. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional for accurate medical advice.

Based on the provided patient data, I will create a comprehensive EHR YAML file. However, please note that the patient's demographics, chief complaint, and medical history are missing. I will make assumptions for the sake of this example.

```yml

patient_info:
  demographics: # Assuming patient demographics are not available
    - name: John Doe
      date_of_birth: 1990-01-01

However, if we were to simulate a patient with some basic information, the YAML file would look like this:

```yml

  demographics:
    - name: John Doe
      date_of_birth: 1990-01-01
      sex: Male
  contact:
    - phone: 555-555-5555
      email: johndoe@example.com

chief_complaint:
  - primary_reason_for_visit: Chest Pain

symptoms:
  - severity_level: Medium
    description: Chest pain radiating to the left arm

vitals:
  - blood_pressure: 120/80
  - heart_rate: 80
  - respiratory_rate: 16
  - oxygen_saturation: 98%

medical_history:
  - past_medical_conditions:
      - Hypertension
      - Hyperlipidemia
  - allergies:
      - Penicillin

assessment:
  - differential_diagnosis:
      - Acute Coronary Syndrome
      - Pulmonary Embolism
  - clinical_impression: Possible Acute Coronary Syndrome

recommendations:
  - next_steps: ECG and Troponin levels
  - follow_up_care: Cardiology consultation

urgency_level:
  - level: High

```
