To create a more comprehensive EHR YAML file, please provide the following information:

1. Patient demographics (name, age, contact information)
2. Chief complaint or reason for visit
3. Symptoms or concerns
4. Medical history (past illnesses, allergies, etc.)
5. Vitals (temperature, blood pressure, etc.)
6. Insurance information

Once this information is available, I can generate a more detailed and accurate EHR YAML file.
